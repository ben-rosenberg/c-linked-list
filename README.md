# Linked List

Expanding my C programming skills by implementing a singly linked-list with integer values. Structure and function declartions are contained in linked_list.h, definitions in linked_list.c, and the program's entry-point in main.c.

As of 5/17/2023, supported functionality includes list creation, node creation, appendment of a new value, appendment of multiple new values, retrieval of a list's length, and output of a list's values to stdout.

Future functionality includes list deletion and clean-up, node removal, and list reversal.
